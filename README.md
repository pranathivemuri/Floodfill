# Floodfill
# look up getSkeletonbycountobjects.py for details and results
# if number of objects are equal before and after removing the pixel 
# it can be deleted and structuring element is a valid deletable template
# using python
# need python > 3 to compile
# uses scipy, numpy, skimage and itertools packages
# 2D sanity check 
# number of deleting templates is 24
# skimage regionprops/ scipy label doesn't works for either 2D or 3D
# find/ write a working model for counting objects. how do you floodfill
