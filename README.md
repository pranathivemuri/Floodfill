# Floodfill
# writing code to find templates based on number of objects before and after removing a center pixel
# using floodfill which turned out to be not a correct approach
# look up getSkeletonbycountobjects.py for details and results
# if equal then the pixel can be deleted and structuring element is a valid deletable template
# using python
# need python > 3 to compile
# uses scipy, numpy and itertools packages
# 2D sanity check 
# number of deleting templates is 24
